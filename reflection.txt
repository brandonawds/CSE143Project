Reflection

We learned about Discords Java Discord API (JDA) and how to create a bot on their platform. We utilized the terms/methods we 
learned in class and was able to implement new codes to expand it. We enjoyed the aspect of being able to create something fun on a platform
we all use. We like playing games so it was a big part of our inspiration. We know what we made is small because of the time constraint we have, but the 
thought that we were even able to create it in the first place, and are cabable of more is exciting. Some things that were challenging was understanding 
the new packages we needed to use and having to transer to Eclipse. It was our first time using that program so it took a little bit to figure out its features.
We approached this project by looking up basic command bots and how those were made. After that, we would test and try to expand from them to get close to what 
we want our bot to do. The Discord site itself was really helpful in guiding users on how to start up a bot on their servers and what limitations it has.
